## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lars Bendik, and I'm part of an intense programming course called Kodehode, specifically the backend part.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on mastering C#, ASP, SQL, Node, and other backend-related languages like Kotlin.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on personal projects, completing a lot of Microsoft Learns different challenges, and messing around with Java/Kotlin/Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I paint a lot of miniatures which I might make an instagram at some point. If I do, the link will be here.
- âš¡ Another fun fact: I'll soon be collaborating on a pretty cool local AI-program using CSnakes, to combine C# and Python.
