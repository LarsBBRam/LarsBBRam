## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lars Bendik, and I'm part of an intense programming course called Kodehode, specifically the backend part.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, ASP, SQL, Node, and other backend-related languages.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects, learning from Microsoft Learn, and from the course.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I paint a lot of miniatures, which I'll make an instagram at some point. <instagram link>
